There are two folders CODE and DOC, and a readme.txt file (which you are reading at this very moment!!!). 
The directory structure can be seen visually by the directory tree diagram above. In the code folder there is the 
data, lib, src, and team_logos folder. The data folder contains the .csv files needed by nba.html and a plethera of 
other data files that can be used to perform data analysis and continue the work of this project. The main data
files are game_details.csv and games.csv, with which you can derrive the other .csv files. game_details.csv contains 
player data for a given game, and games.csv contains game related stats and who played against who when.

The lib folder contains the d3 libraries needed by nba.htlm. team_logos contains the team logo images used by
nba.html. The src folder contains the jupyter and r files used to conduct data collection and analysis. The process of
data collection and analysis can be automated using these files with a few tweeks. The Twitter_Sampling.ipynd and 
team052_nba_datataccess.ipynb files can be used for data collection which can feed into the team052_finalscoresprediction.ipynb
and team052_nba_team_player.ipynb files for further processing. Then the R files, team052_data_exploratory_nba.R and
team052_modeling.R can be used to perform the prediction analysis and output it into csvs like gameid_xxxxx.csv which can 
finally be used by nba.html.
